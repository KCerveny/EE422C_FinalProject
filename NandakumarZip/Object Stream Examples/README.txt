This example shows how you can set up your projects and packages to use Object streams for server/client I/O.
Create a new project from the Client folder.
Create a separate project from the Server folder.
Running the Server project's main followed by the Client project's should result in
the Server printing messages corresponding to the Message objects created by the Client.
